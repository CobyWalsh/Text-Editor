# Text-Editor

## Description

In this project I have created a PWA text editor web aplication that can be downloaded and accessable offline. I have bundled my files using webpack, my JavaScript, HTML, service worker and a manifest file have all been generated when I use next-gen JavaScript in my application.  When I run the command 'npm run start' in the command line, my application will start up the backend and serve the client. When I open the text editor I find that IndexDB has created a database storage and when I enter text and click off the DOM window the content has been retrieved from the IndexDB. When I click the install button the web application creates an icon on my desktop and loads my web application. When I load my web application a registered service worker is using workbox to load my static pre cached assets. I have deployed my application to Heroku.
